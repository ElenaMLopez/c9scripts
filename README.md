# c9scripts

Here we will put the c9 scripts to make easier to work with

### Avalable Scripts:

- **[Install MongoDB](https://github.com/OSWeekends/c9scripts/blob/master/mongoscriptc9.sh)**
- **[Install Node Global Dependencies](https://github.com/OSWeekends/c9scripts/blob/master/node_global_dependencies.sh)** _It will install Bower, Gulp, Grunt, Yeoman and solve the SUDO issue_

### Need more?

**Ask for them!** You only need to rise an [issue](https://github.com/OSWeekends/c9scripts/issues) :-)
