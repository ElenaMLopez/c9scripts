# c9scripts

Here we will put the c9 scripts to make easier to work with.

Its important to know that every script must be an executable file.
For that porpouse write in the same folder you have the script:
"chmod 755 nameOfTheScript.sh"

### Avalable Scripts:

- **[Install MongoDB](https://github.com/OSWeekends/c9scripts/blob/master/mongoscriptc9.sh)** _It will install mongodb and give you instructions on how it works on c9_
- **[Install Node Global Dependencies](https://github.com/OSWeekends/c9scripts/blob/master/node_global_dependencies.sh)** _It will install Bower, Gulp, Grunt, Yeoman and solve the SUDO issue_
